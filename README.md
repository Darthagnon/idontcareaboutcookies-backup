# idontcareaboutcookies-backup
Browser extension idontcareaboutcookies recently sold out to Avast, the trashy antivirus company that bought out (and ruined) Piriform CCleaner (and the rest of their products). This is a backup of the last good version before the acquisition, **v3.4.2.0**

That said, no malicious/advertising changes have been confirmed yet.

- [Filterlist](https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/abp/) (this seems to have a different version string, and is more transparent than the extension. I only got v343, [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/abp/))

## Missing:
- Opera
- Edgium

I wasn't fast enough to grab v3.4.2.0 of either of those browser's versions, but the Chromium version of the extension should work fine.
